### Grain Growth
* The grain growth is enhanced when the dopant concentration in the grains is above the solid solubility limit

 Characterized by two mechanisms
#### Primary recrystallization
driven by the defect energy
The transition os continuous:  grains are growing from a large amount of tiny grains to a small amount of large grains,
#### secondary recrystallization.
deduced from the grain boundary energy

Polysilicon, however, is primarily growing via secondary grain growth. Some existing primary grains have preferred energetic properties and start to grow with an extraordinary growth rate. During the growth process they coalesce with adjacent smaller grains to form secondary grains
